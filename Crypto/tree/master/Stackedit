Here are the  **Neo4j-recommended**  Cypher coding standards that we use in this training:

-   Node labels are CamelCase and begin with an upper-case letter (examples:  _Person_,  _NetworkAddress_). Note that node labels are case-sensitive.
-   Property keys, variables, parameters, aliases, and functions are camelCase and begin with a lower-case letter (examples:  _businessAddress_,  _title_). Note that these elements are case-sensitive.
-   Relationship types are in upper-case and can use the underscore. (examples:  _ACTED_IN_,  _FOLLOWS_). Note that relationship types are case-sensitive and that you cannot use the “-” character in a relationship type.
-   Cypher keywords are upper-case (examples:  `MATCH`,  `RETURN`). Note that Cypher keywords are case-insensitive, but a best practice is to use upper-case.
-   String constants are in single quotes, unless the string contains a quote or apostrophe (examples:  _‘The Matrix’_,  _“Something’s Gotta Give”_). Note that you can also escape single or double quotes within strings that are quoted with the same using a backslash character.
-   Specify variables only when needed for use later in the Cypher statement.
-   Place named nodes and relationships (that use variables) before anonymous nodes and relationships in your  `MATCH`  clauses when possible.
-   Specify anonymous relationships with  `-->`,  `--`, or  `<--`
